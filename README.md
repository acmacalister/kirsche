# Kirsche

Kirsche is a compiler for a simple programming language written in Zig. It is a work in progress and is not yet complete. It is based on the book "Writing An Interpreter In Go" by Thorsten Ball. You should buy it if you are interested in writing interpreters or compilers. Great way to learn a new language.
